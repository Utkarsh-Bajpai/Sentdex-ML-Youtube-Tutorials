# Sentdex-ML-Youtube-Tutorials
Repo for code of Practical Machine Learning Tutorial with Python Youtube tutorial by sentdex. The objective of this course is to give a holistic understanding of machine learning, covering theory, application, and inner workings of supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning algorithms.
In this series, we covered linear regression, K Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machines (SVM), flat clustering, hierarchical clustering, and neural networks.

For each major algorithm that we cover, we discussed the high level intuitions of the algorithms and how they are logically meant to work. Next, we applied the algorithms in code using real world data sets along with a module, such as with Scikit-Learn. Finally, we be dived into the inner workings of each of the algorithms by recreating them in code, from scratch, ourselves, including all of the math involved. This should gives a complete understanding of exactly how the algorithms work, how they can be tweaked, what advantages are, and what their disadvantages are. 

Machine learning was defined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel as the "field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This means imbuing knowledge to machines without hard-coding it.
